# Yep, this is another typically todo app :memo:

This app is build to learn the mern stack and also I'm trying use a clean folder structure, this project is divided into a `client` with vite and react and a `server` with express and mongo

## Project structure :card_file_box:
```
client/
	src/
	package.json
	vite.config.js
server/
	src/
	package.json
	.env
```

## Installation :sparkles:

Clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/cristianqsanchez/todo-app.git
```
